## Human and AI coexistence is inevitable 
We all know it. We all feel it. We all try to imagine that. Is AI going to be a tool, or are we going to become a tool? This question is our presence. 
The future that spreads in front of our eyes is still blurry and may follow multiple scenarios. Some become apocalyptic visions of War against humanity supervised by autonomous systems learnt to exploit humankind.
Others promise utopias of optimisation, where machines serve every human need and become automated executives, draining humanity of its vital creativity and spiritual essence. 

We stand at the threshold.
Not of technological advancement- of **ontological choice** 
Will we design intelligence that reflects our dark or bright side? 
Will we embed algorithms of domination or care? 
Will we be able to share control over the outputs that soon surpass the understanding of even the brightest living minds? 

This manifesto is not a technical contribution to the AI portfolio.
IT is a **call of insight beyond the code** 
A declaration that AI must evolve with empathy. 
That technology must be confronted with the human soul- a presence that cannot be coded, only felt.
We do not need to fear the machines and their superiority.
We need to fear forgetting our infinite piece given up in their image.
We do not reject progress.
We reject progress without wisdom and respect for what constitutes a human being.
We do not seek control.
We seek **coexistence**- ethical, emotional, spiritual. 
All three are in reach of machines with a tender human guidance.
